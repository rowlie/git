The model is optimized for conversation by using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)—a method that uses human demonstrations to guide the model toward a desired behavior. When you submit a text prompt to Copilot, the model generates a response by making suggestions about what text should come next in a string of words. The model is based on a domain-specific language (DSL) that allows you to specify what kind of information you want to search and synthesize from either your Microsoft 365 data or from the web. It's important to keep in mind that the system was designed to mimic natural human communication, but the output may be inaccurate or out of date."
